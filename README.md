## Paywall calculator web

A [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) app that allows users to make paid arithmetic operations by showcasing some of the most common needs of a REST API

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm start

```

## Test

Didn't have enough time to invest on this so I just tested one file as a showcase of how to test React

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm test -- src/auth/auth.guard.spec.ts

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
